title:            Wake Up: Young Buddhists and non-Buddhists for a Healthy and Compassionate Society
description:      Wake Up is an active global community of young adults, aged 18-35, established by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh in 2008. We come together to practice mindfulness to take care of ourselves and help transform society. We follow the Five Mindfulness Trainings, which are ethical guidelines that offer concrete practices of true love and understanding, and a path towards a life in harmony with each other and the Earth.
